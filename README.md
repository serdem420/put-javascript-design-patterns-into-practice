# [Put JavaScript Design Patterns Into Practice][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


A design pattern is a proven solution to a common software problem. Patterns codify good design principles and facilitate maintainable code that can be worked on by teams.
Design patterns are also a way for teams to communicate about the structure and architecture of an application. Patterns are a language that can be used to convey  ideas and facilitate discussions.

In this course, Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will cover some of the most common and most useful design patterns used in JavaScript. Each pattern will be demonstrated with a standalone example bundled in a JavaScript module.
